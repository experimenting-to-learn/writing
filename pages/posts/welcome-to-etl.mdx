# Welcome to Experimenting To Learn

Welcome to our new blog focused on **Experimenting To Learn (ETL)** - a methodology that applies data engineering principles to knowledge transfer and documentation.

## What is ETL for Learning?

In traditional data engineering, ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load - a process for moving and processing data. We apply this same paradigm to knowledge and learning:

### Extract ðŸ“¥
- Gather information from multiple sources
- Collect experiences and insights
- Identify knowledge gaps

### Transform ðŸ”„
- Process raw information into structured knowledge
- Apply learning frameworks and methodologies
- Create connections between concepts

### Load ðŸ“¤
- Deliver processed knowledge through documentation
- Make information accessible and searchable
- Enable knowledge sharing across teams

## Why Documentation as Code?

By treating documentation as code, we can:
- Version control our knowledge
- Collaborate on content creation
- Maintain consistency across projects
- Automate documentation workflows

Stay tuned for more posts exploring these concepts in depth!
