# Experimenting To Learn (ETL)

Welcome to our documentation and learning blog. We explore data-driven knowledge transfer methodologies using the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) paradigm.

This blog is built with **Next.js** and [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/), focusing on documentation-as-code principles and knowledge management strategies.

## What is ETL in Learning?

- **Extract**: Gathering knowledge from various sources and experiences
- **Transform**: Processing and structuring information for better understanding
- **Load**: Delivering processed knowledge through accessible documentation

## Topics We Cover

- Data-driven documentation strategies
- Knowledge management systems
